# Curb Alert

## Epicodus Capstone Project Proposal

#### **Name of Student:** Christopher Neal

#### **Name of Project:** Curb Alert

### **Project's Purpose or Goal:**

> Allow users to find discarded furniture and housewares on the sidewalk. You see a couch on the curb. It’s in good shape but you already have a couch. You see rainclouds looming. That couch is going to get destroyed… unless somebody picks it up. You take a picture with Curb Alert, and the app automatically and anonymously posts the picture and location. Another user sees a listing of a sidewalk freebie nearby. They come to the location, pick it up, and hit the “Taken” button. The listing is marked as taken.

### MVP:

#### **List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:**

- Allow users to post a picture with location
- Allow users to see nearby posts, by user location or by entering zip code
- Allow users to mark posts as “Taken,” have posts disappear after x hours

#### **What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.**

- JavaScript
- React Native
- Firebase
- Access to location and camera
- Map interface module

### Stretch Goals:

#### **If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.**

- Allow for different class of posts that can’t be marked as “Taken” but automatically expires after a week for things like fruit trees, or tiny libraries
- Allow app to notify user when there’s a new post in their area
- Allow user authentication/authorization
- Allow users to report images as inappropriate
- Allow users to add a title to a post
- Only allow users to mark posts as “Taken” if they are nearby
- Allow users to tag a post with “still here”
- Allow users to update a post if one thing out of a group has been taken
- Allow multiple images per post, or allow other users to submit images to an existing post
- Allow users to anonymously thank the post maker
- Gamify app so users get points whenever something they post gets picked up
- Allow users to track their walk and get points for walking
- Allow users to see nearby roads that have been recently trafficked by other users

#### **What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?**

- Google-based React authentication with firebase

#### **Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?**

> This app only makes sense on mobile, so I’m eager to learn React Native to make it happen.
